# sketchcode-api-lib
Sketchcode API coroutine-based multiplatform library


**Now the library and API is really unstable. It has no backward compatible. Any update now can change everything. That will be until the [android app](https://github.com/kotlingang/sketchcode-android-app) will be released**


You can use it anywhere, even in JS, Python, C

To request actual buildings for those platforms, please create an issue
